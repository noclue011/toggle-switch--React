## General Information
This project was created to give myself a reusable toggle switch component to import into future projects (whenever I need a toggle switch). It also serves as a newsletter opt-in component that can be imported into future projects too. This training project also helped me to further learn how to use React.

## Technologies Used
* Javascript 1.5
* React 17.0.2
* Sass 1.49.0
* HTML


## Features
* There is a toggle switch to opt into marketing emails, along with 3 more switches to choose what type of emails to get.
* The 3 types of marketing emails can only be selected if the switch for opting into marketing emails is switched on.
* Below the switches is a section that shows the state of each switch as "true" or "false" in real-time
